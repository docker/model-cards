# Llama 3.3

![logo](https://github.com/docker/model-cards/raw/refs/heads/main/logos/meta-280x184-overview@2x.svg)

Meta Llama 3.3 is a powerful 70B parameter multilingual language model designed by Meta for text-based tasks like chat and content generation. The instruction-tuned version is optimized for multilingual dialogue and performs better than many open-source and commercial models on common benchmarks.

## Intended uses

- **Multilingual assistant-like chat**: Using instruction-tuned models for conversational AI across multiple languages, enabling natural and context-aware interactions in various linguistic settings.

- **Coding support and software development tasks**: Leveraging language models to assist with code generation, debugging, documentation, and other software engineering workflows.

- **Multilingual content creation and localization**: Generating and adapting written content across different languages and cultures, supporting global communication and engagement.

- **Knowledge-based applications**: Integrating LLMs with structured or unstructured data sources to answer questions, extract insights, or support decision-making.

- **General natural language generation**: Various NLG tasks such as summarization, translation, or content generation across different domains.

- **Synthetic data generation (synth)**: Creating realistic, high-quality synthetic text data to augment datasets for training, testing, or anonymization purposes.
