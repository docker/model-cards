SmolLM2-360M is a compact language model with 360 million parameters, designed to run efficiently on-device while performing a wide range of language tasks. Trained on 4 trillion tokens from a diverse mix of datasets—including FineWeb-Edu, DCLM, The Stack, and newly curated filtered sources—it delivers strong performance in instruction following, knowledge, and reasoning. The instruct version was developed through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a blend of public and proprietary datasets, followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using UltraFeedback.
